## Introduction to Quantum Monte Carlo

Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a large class of computer algorithms that simulate quantum systems with the goal of solving the quantum many-body problem. 
QMC methods are used to compute quantum properties of a system with many interacting particles. 
These algorithms use random sampling to evaluate multi-dimensional integrals, which makes them well-suited to studying systems where 
the wave function of the system is complex and not easily solvable by deterministic methods.

For a comprehensive introduction to Quantum Monte Carlo methods, the following references are a good starting point:

- "Quantum Monte Carlo Methods: Algorithms for Lattice Models" by James Gubernatis and Naoki Kawashima.
- "Quantum Monte Carlo Approaches for Correlated Systems" by Federico Becca and Sandro Sorella.
- "Electronic Structure Calculations on Graphics Processing Units: From Quantum Chemistry to Condensed Matter Physics" by Ross C. Walker and Andreas W. GÃ¶tz.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to run the calculations:

### Example 1: Helium Atom VMC

Run a VMC simulation for a Helium atom:
To start a simulation, navigate to the program's directory and run: python3 montecarlo.py

When prompted, input:

- Number of electrons: 2
- Number of nuclei: 1
- Variational parameter `a`: 1.8
- Atomic weight: 2
- Total charge: 0
- Number of Monte Carlo steps: 10000

Choose `1` for Variational Monte Carlo.

### Example 2: Hydrogen Molecule PDMC

Run a PDMC simulation for a Hydrogen molecule (H2):

When prompted, input:

- Number of electrons: 2
- Number of nuclei: 2
- Variational parameter `a`: 1.2
- Atomic weight: 1
- Total charge: 0
- Number of Monte Carlo steps: 20000

Choose `2` for Pure Diffusion Monte Carlo.
